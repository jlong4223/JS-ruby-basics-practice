# Javascript and Ruby Practice

This is a place that I go to practice code challenges and keep the basics fresh.

A goal of mine here is to complete a code challenge in javascript and transfer it to ruby or vice-versa.

The challenges will range from easy to expert level in time.

## Technologies:

- ruby
- javscript
